## Plan

1. Quick remeinder of the standard pipeline
2. The story following a list of upgrades
3. The XP eveidence backing the story
4. The figure of merits

# Standard pipeline

---
## Algo

1. Take a 1D descriptions of the events
2. Binning to extract summary statistics -> $n_i$
3. Apply maximum likelihood point estimation -> $\hat \mu$
4. Invert test statistic (profiled likelihood included)

\begin{equation}
  \frac{H(\mu = \hat \mu)}{H(\mu \neq \hat \mu)}
\end{equation}

---
## The model

The model used to apply maximum likelihood is the binned poisson likelihood combined with the calibration.

\begin{equation}
  L(\mu, \alpha) = L(Calib | \alpha) \times \prod_{i=0}^K Poisson(n_i | \mu \gamma_i + \beta_i)
\end{equation}

---
# Upgrades

---
## Upgrades chain

1. Best feature
2. Classifier
3. Robust classifier
4. Inference aware neural network
5. Upgrade model

---
## Best feature

For all features use the standard pipeline on it.

Choose the feature giving the smaller interval.

---
## Classifier

Dimension reduction to 1D.

Trying to separate signal events and background events.

cf inverse fisher and Cramer Rao bound without systematics

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^K \frac{\gamma_i^2}{\mu \gamma_i + \beta_i } \leq \frac{(\sum_{i=0}^K \gamma_i)^2}{\sum_{i=0}^K \mu \gamma_i + \beta_i }
\end{equation}

---
## Classifier

Tries to concentrate all the information about $\mu$ inside one feature.


---
## Robust classifier

Starting point for us.

The classifier method does not include systematic effect.

Build a 1D reduction robust to systematic effect.
(Data augmentation, Pivot, Tangent Propagation)

---
## INFERNO

Differentiable simulator (up to the parameters $\mu, \alpha$) allows to directly optimize the binning.



---
## Upgrade model

The summary statistics $n_i$ contain mostly information about $\mu$ but both $\mu$ and $\alpha$ are required.

Why not including more information extracted from the data ?

---
## Upgrade model

Using a regressor (mamouth) trained to regress $\alpha$ we shoud extract as much information about $\alpha$ as possible.

Then we include it in the model.

\begin{equation}
  L(\mu, \alpha) = L_c(Calib | \alpha) \times L_e(extra | \alpha) \times \prod_{i=0}^K Poisson(n_i | \mu \gamma_i + \beta_i)
\end{equation}

# Experimental evidence


---
## On toys

- robustness works
- INFERNO works
- extra info works

---
## On Higgs

- difficult because signals << backgrounds
- no method gives good results
- Extra information still makes it better

---
## Need more bins for higgs


---
# Figure of merits

---
## Mean squared error

The empirical mean squared error of the maximum likelihood estimator.


---
## The length of a 1 $\sigma$ interval

The average length of the estimated confidence interval.

---
## Coverage probability of a 1 $\sigma$ interval

Empirical coverage probability of the interval.

## Conclusion
